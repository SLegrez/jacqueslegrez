# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   'true': 'foo'

    text_html: "<span class='beige'>Jacques Legrez</span> lives and work in <span
        class='beige'>Bourgogne</span>. His painting brings together three essential themes of
        pictorial art, contemporary abstraction, landscape and portrait. Trained in the school of
        classical painting, that of the Flemish Primitives, the painters of the Quattrocento and
        the Dutch Masters, his work is part of the specific approach to any creator : to be inspired
        by reality and, in the search for a provisional absolute, lifting the veil on an imaginary
        horizon."

      « <span class='beige'>To paint is to start by being silent.</span> And listen. Listen to
      people, objects, silences, drafts. How to resist time and precariousness other than through
      the creative act ? Have we invented anything more wonderful than the hand, this shell of
      flesh, blood and love which collects emotion and which emotion on the canvas in a mind's eye?
      In the early days of the <span class= 'beige'> creation </span>, they were a few to draw in
      the middle of the night, with one hand trembling on the walls of a cave. To better ward off
      bloody and miserable fate reserved for them, the free figure of an animal taken from life
      became for them the embryo of a better life. This fiction laid the foundations for a world
      devoid of all danger by only still fragile power of the imagination.

      <p>
        A few thousand years later, it is the same men, a handful, who in the Plain of Marathon
        chose to repel the invader and lived through the hell of death under axes and blades of
        barbarians. The Acropolis hill, the Parthenon marbles, the circumference of the theater
        of Epidaurus turned towards the sea, present in their flesh and blood, galvanized their
        forces. Came the Renaissance. <span class= 'beige'> Botticelli </span> stared at the
        spring without the slightest cloud obscuring the freshness of her composition despite the
        years. The <span class = 'beige'> Caravaggio </span> shaped the day and night on the face
        of each of its characters. He disappeared, keeping as a secret the perfection of all
        human form. The man whose hand trembled in the dawn of time had not resigned himself. He
        continued his path on the path of the imagination and got closer of the dream in the
        learning of the line and the material. His daring fueled by his vision distinguished the
        beauty of the light to better associate them in the coat of a <span class= 'beige'> work
        of art </span>, hoisting Western civilization at arm's length. Such a torch, it
        distributed both worry and happiness and shone on the world. Then came new men. They
        lined up miles of rails. Came the locomotives. Engines. Then the fog of the locomotives,
        the noise of the engines. It had to set a standard. It was the straight line. He had to
        be dressed. He was offered speed.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      Mastering the <span class= 'beige'> speed </span>, chaining records mobilized all energies.
      In the silence of laboratories and the labyrinth of experimental research, man reaped the
      discoveries, unmasked the unknowns and lost his heart. Its vertically oriented telescope
      opened up the darkness of space to him. The spirit of <span class= 'beige'> conquest </span>
      was activated. No more hearing, touch, smell. Lost the smile and the tears. Dropped the
      sweat, the sperm and the saliva. A polar cold was preparing to bury the honey of existence.
      Take a detour became a waste of <span class= 'beige'> time </span>. The curve, this
      oscillation of the line which suggests the shade was stored in the closet. Looking to see was
      seen as a weakness. Linger, a anomaly. We had to act. And <span class= 'beige'> quickly
      </span>. Following his instinct was seen as childish. To seek the soul of everything, a
      resignation.
    </p> 
    <div class='picntext'>
      <p>
        Today, <span class= 'beige'> who </span> would dare to take up arms for defend and
        save the palace of Jacques Coeur in Bourges, the crusaders of the Holy Chapelle, the memory
        of Arthur Rimbaud? <span class= 'beige'> Who </span> would accept risk his life for the
        gardens of Le Nôtre, the walls of Chambord, the Loire Valley or Lunch on the Grassby Claude
        Monet? <span class= 'beige'> Who </span> would agree to lose all credit to become what it has
        always been? <span class= 'beige'> Who </span> would simply accept being himself in order to
        exist? And if everything was needed restart ? Start by being silent. To fear. And in the
        folds of a cold blue night of December, feel. And tremble. »
